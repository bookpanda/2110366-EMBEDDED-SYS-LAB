# Final Project - Alcohol sensor

## Wiring
Connect the MQ-3 Alcohol sensor to the NUCLEO-F411RE as follows (left is MQ-3, right is NUCLEO-F411RE):
- VCC -> 5V
- GND -> GND
- A0 (analog) -> A0
- D0 (digital) no need for this one

## Measurements
Around 2700-2800 is the threshold for detecting alcohol.
- Ambient air: 600-700
- Normal breath: 600-700
- Intoxicated breath: 
- Put next to open alcohol spray bottle: 1300-2500
- After spraying alcohol on the sensor: 2700-3000
